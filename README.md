## Dependencies

This project requires Node.js and NPM.
  
## Getting Started

Start with cloning this repo on your local machine:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/leobabakhanian/movie-mania.git
```

Once you have cloned the project, open two separate terminals and change the directory to 'client' and 'server' on each respective terminal. From there, run npm install inside both the client and server directories to install the required dependencies. When this step is completed, run the command "npm start" inside both the client and server directories to view the live version of the web application. For the server, you will not be able to run it until you create your own MongoDB cluster and paste it in the CONNECTION_URL variable inside of server/index.js.
